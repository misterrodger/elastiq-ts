## Publishing the Beta

### Manual Publish (Recommended for First Release)

```bash
# Ensure you're logged in to npm
npm login

# Verify everything is ready
npm run test
npm run type-check
npm run build

# Publish as beta
npm publish --tag beta

# Verify publication
npm view elastiq@0.1.0-beta
```

This publishes with the `beta` tag, so users must explicitly install the beta version.

## Installation

Beta users can install:

```bash
# Latest beta
npm install elastiq@beta

# Specific version
npm install elastiq@0.1.0-beta
```

## Quick Start for Beta Testers

```typescript
import { query } from 'elastiq';

type Product = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  embedding?: number[];
};

// Type-safe query building with vector search
const q = query<Product>()
  .bool()
  .must(q => q.match('name', 'laptop'))
  .filter(q => q.range('price', { gte: 500, lte: 2000 }))
  .knn('embedding', [0.1, 0.2, ...], { k: 10, num_candidates: 100 })
  .suggest(s => s.completion('name-suggestions', 'lap', { field: 'name' }))
  .from(0)
  .size(20)
  .build();

// Send to Elasticsearch
client.search({ index: 'products', ...q });
```

## What "Beta" Means

This library is in **beta**, which means:

- **The API may change** - We're gathering feedback and refining the design based on real-world usage
- **Breaking changes are possible** - Between beta versions as we discover better patterns
- **Use with caution** - Well-tested, but still evolving
- **Feedback is essential** - Help shape the final API by reporting what works and what doesn't

## Version Bumping

For subsequent beta releases:

```bash
# In package.json, increment the beta number or minor version
"version": "0.1.1-beta"  # For bug fixes
"version": "0.2.0-beta"  # For new features

# Publish
npm publish --tag beta
```

## Next Steps After Publishing

1. **Verify** the package on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/elastiq
2. **Test** installation in a fresh project
3. **Create** a GitHub release with changelog
4. **Gather** feedback from users
5. **Iterate** based on real-world usage
